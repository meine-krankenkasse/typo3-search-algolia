/**
 * Event listener for enhancing page documents with site-specific information and content.
 *
 * This listener responds to AfterDocumentAssembledEvent events that are dispatched
 * after a page document has been assembled. It enhances the document by adding
 * various page-specific fields:
 * - Site domain (for identifying which site the page belongs to)
 * - Last changed timestamp (for sorting and filtering by modification date)
 * - Page URL (for linking to the page in search results)
 * - Page content (optionally, by aggregating content from all content elements on the page)
 *
 * The content aggregation is particularly important for full-text search, as it allows
 * users to find pages based on the text within their content elements, not just the
 * page's own metadata. This content is only included if the indexing service is
 * configured to include content elements (isIncludeContentElements() returns true).
 *
 * These enhancements make page search results more useful by providing both
 * the necessary metadata for display and filtering, as well as the actual
 * content for comprehensive full-text search capabilities.
