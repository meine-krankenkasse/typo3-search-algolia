/**
 * Event listener for handling record move operations in the search indexing system.
 *
 * This listener responds to DataHandlerRecordMoveEvent events that are dispatched
 * when records are moved in the TYPO3 backend or through the DataHandler API.
 * It ensures that the search index is updated to reflect the new location of the record.
 *
 * The listener performs the following tasks:
 * - Verifies that the record has actually changed location (different target and source PIDs)
 * - Determines the root page ID for the moved record to establish the correct indexing context
 * - Updates the record in the indexing queue to ensure it will be re-indexed
 * - For content elements, also processes the page that previously contained the element
 *   to ensure that page's index entry is updated to reflect the removal of the content
 *
 * This listener is essential for maintaining the integrity of the search index
 * when content is reorganized within the TYPO3 page tree.
