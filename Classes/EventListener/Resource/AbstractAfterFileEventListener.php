/**
 * Abstract base class for file event listeners in the search indexing system.
 *
 * This class provides common functionality for all event listeners that respond
 * to TYPO3 file events (added, deleted, moved, renamed, etc.). It:
 * - Defines the common dependencies needed by all file event listeners
 * - Provides access to the event dispatcher for dispatching search-related events
 * - Provides access to the file handler for working with file metadata
 *
 * Concrete implementations extend this class and implement the __invoke method
 * to handle specific file events, typically by retrieving the file's metadata UID
 * and dispatching appropriate DataHandler events to ensure that file metadata
 * is properly indexed or removed from the search engine.
