/**
 * Repository for managing indexing queue items.
 *
 * This repository provides methods for working with the indexing queue:
 * - Retrieving queue items for processing by the indexing system
 * - Adding new items to the queue when content is created or modified
 * - Removing items from the queue after processing or when content is deleted
 * - Generating statistics about the current state of the queue
 *
 * The repository uses both Extbase's persistence layer for standard operations
 * and direct database queries via TYPO3's ConnectionPool for performance-critical
 * operations like bulk inserts and statistics gathering.
