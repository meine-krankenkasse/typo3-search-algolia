/**
 * This event is triggered when a record is deleted in the TYPO3 system.
 *
 * The event is dispatched by the DataHandlerHook when a record is deleted in the TYPO3
 * backend or through the DataHandler API. It provides information about which record
 * was deleted (table name and record UID) to allow event listeners to perform
 * related actions, such as:
 * - Removing the record from search indices
 * - Cleaning up related data in other systems
 * - Logging deletion operations for auditing purposes
 *
 * This event is particularly important for the search indexing system, as it allows
 * for automatic removal of deleted records from search indices to keep them in sync
 * with the TYPO3 database.
