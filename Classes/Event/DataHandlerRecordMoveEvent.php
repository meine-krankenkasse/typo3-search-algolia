/**
 * This event is triggered when a record is moved to a different location in the TYPO3 system.
 *
 * The event is dispatched by the DataHandlerHook when a record is moved in the TYPO3
 * backend or through the DataHandler API. It provides information about:
 * - Which record was moved (table name and record UID)
 * - Where the record was moved to (target PID)
 * - Where the record was moved from (previous PID, if available)
 *
 * Event listeners can use this information to perform related actions, such as:
 * - Updating the record in search indices to reflect its new location
 * - Updating related records that might be affected by the move
 * - Logging move operations for auditing purposes
 *
 * This event is particularly important for the search indexing system, as it allows
 * for automatic updating of moved records in search indices to keep them in sync
 * with the TYPO3 database structure.
