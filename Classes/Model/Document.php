/**
 * Model representing a document to be indexed in the search engine.
 *
 * This class serves as a container for document data that will be sent to the search
 * engine for indexing. It provides methods for:
 * - Storing and retrieving document fields and their values
 * - Accessing the original record data from the TYPO3 database
 * - Referencing the indexer that created the document
 *
 * Documents are typically created by the DocumentBuilder during the indexing process
 * and then passed to a search engine service for actual indexing. The document
 * structure is flexible, allowing for different field sets based on the record type
 * and indexing configuration.
